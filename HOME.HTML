        <p>Operation SINDOOR was a series of precision strikes by the Indian Armed Forces against terrorist
            infrastructure
            in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, launched in early May 2025, following the Pahalgam terror attack.
            The
            operation aimed to dismantle terrorist bases and punish those responsible for the attack, while also
            demonstrating India's resolve and technological capabilities in counter-terrorism operationsZZZZ</p>
